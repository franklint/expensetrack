## Usage
This full-stack application utilizes technologies such as Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars and Heroku to create an interactive application for the user. The application accepts inputs from the user such as their email, monthly expenses, paid expenses, and calculates their outstanding expenses for them.

## Features
On the home page, the user is prompted to enter their email address and password and sign-up! The user can select from a choice of monthly expenses such as Rent, Credit Card payments, etc and enter their amount. The user can also select which of these expenses have been paid so the application can tell them their outstanding expenses.
